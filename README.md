## Description

- I have been tasked to refactor the existing code with the intention of improving it without changing the output, also to improve its accessibility.

- I have improved the structure of the header and attempted to improve the main section

- I have added 'alt' attributes to all 'img' elements

- The heading attributes fall in sequential order
